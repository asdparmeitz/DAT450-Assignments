Anatomy

Anatomy (Greek anatomē, “dissection”) is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts.  Anatomy is a branch of natural science dealing with the structural organization of living things.  It is an old science, having its beginnings in prehistoric times.  Anatomy is inherently tied to embryology, comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, and phylogeny, as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate (embryology) and long (evolution) timescales.  Human anatomy is one of the basic essential sciences of medicine.

The discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic anatomy.  Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight.  Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy.  Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells.

The history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body.  Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.

Anatomy and physiology, which study (respectively) the structure and function of organisms and their parts, make a natural pair of related disciplines, and they are often studied together.

Derived from the Greek ἀνατομή "anatomē" "dissection" (from ἀνατέμνω "anatémnō" "I cut up, cut open" from ἀνά "aná" "up", and τέμνω "témnō" "I cut"), anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems, organs and tissues.  It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts.  Anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry, which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved.  For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver; while a physiologist is interested in the production of bile, the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions.

The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy.  Gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features.  Microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including histology (the study of tissues), and embryology (the study of an organism in its immature condition).

Anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non-invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems.  Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures.  Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels.

The term "anatomy" is commonly taken to refer to human anatomy.  However, substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals.  The term "zootomy" is also sometimes used to specifically refer to animals.  The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in plant anatomy.

The kingdom Animalia or metazoa, contains multicellular organisms that are heterotrophic and motile (although some have secondarily adopted a sessile lifestyle).  Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans.  They have an internal digestive chamber, with one or two openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development.  Metazoans do not include the sponges, which have undifferentiated cells.

Unlike plant cells, animal cells have neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts. Vacuoles, when present, are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell.  The body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell, including those found in muscles, nerves and skin.  Each typically has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids, cytoplasm and a nucleus.  All of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers. Those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic.  All of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo, the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.

Animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types: connective, epithelial, muscle and nervous tissue.

Connective tissues are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix.  Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place.  The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone.  The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen.  Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues.  The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body.  An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects.  An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, as well as in many of those less developed.

Epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space.  Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells.  There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function.  In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi.  Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body.  Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin.  The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle.  In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins.  In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.

Muscle cells (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body.  Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs.  Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle.  Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically.  It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths.  It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension.  It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws.  Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two.  The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions.  In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets.  Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.

Nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information.  In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles.  In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus.  In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts of the organism.  Neurons can be connected together in ganglia.  In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system.  The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs.  The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach.

All vertebrates have a similar basic body plan and at some point in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus.  The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it.  Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm.  At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut.  The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail.  The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae.  In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood.  Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost.  The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor.  This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.

The body of a fish is divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible.  The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish.  The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong.  The ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles.  The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine.  They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.  The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop.  The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision.  There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear.  Low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.

Sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage.  Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head.  The dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales.  They have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder.  Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, yolky eggs.  Some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.

The bony fish lineage shows more derived anatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish.  They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum, and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout.  The dermis is covered with overlapping scales.  Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca.  They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.

Amphibians are a class of animals comprising frogs, salamanders and caecilians.  They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size.  Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes.  Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae.  Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified.  Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands.  The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle.  They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea.  Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils.  These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.  They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.

In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs.  The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing.  Frogs have large eyes and no tail.  Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail.  Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless.  They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.

Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles.  They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size.  Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians.  The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size.  The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer.  Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls.  The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams.  The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species.  The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species.  The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.

Turtles are notable for their protective shells.  They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below.  These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine.  The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell.  Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates.  In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.

Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period.  There is one living species, "Sphenodon punctatus".  The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull.  There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews.  The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down.  The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi.  The tuatara has a well-developed parietal eye on its forehead.

Lizards have skulls with only one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost.  This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider.  Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes.  Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.

Snakes are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the Cretaceous period, and they share many of the same features.  The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs.  The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole.  Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent "spectacle" scales.  They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull.  Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.

Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth.  The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed.  It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming.  The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull.  The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating.  Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged.  Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.

Birds are tetrapods but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight.  Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles.  The long bones are thin, hollow and very light.  Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones.  The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused.  There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak.  The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls.  They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.

The feathers are outgrowths of the epidermis and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin.  Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds.  The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near the base of the tail.  This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens.  There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.

Mammals are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight.  They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings.  The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground.  The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel.  The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in cetaceans.  Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear.  They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat.  Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young.  Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs.  The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate.  Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.

Mammals are amniotes, and most are viviparous, giving birth to live young.  The exception to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia.  Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development.

Humans have the overall body plan of a mammal.  Humans have a head, neck, trunk (which includes the thorax and abdomen), two arms and hands, and two legs and feet.
